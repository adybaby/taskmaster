chart filter - date picker, second day does not default to after the first

fixed browser nav/url redux syncing bug.
found new bug: interest is not deleted from server cache when deleting a task. (requires server restart after deleting task to fix)

style tidying

tasks - 
active period if driver or enabler. 
notification if a task if associated with an inactive driver/enabler.
copy task.
drivers, enablers and initiatives are sorted into priority order. when sorting in priority order, they are split up into their separate categories with headings.
filter options - hide inactive drivers and enablers.

chart to show signups on a user basis
chart to show availability on a user basis

fwds/bkwds browser buttons aren't wokring
add task (inc if user is allowed to add drivers and enablers)
sign ups and availability by user
prioritisation in map (inc priority 1 of x and a seeding hint)

nice to have:
version tracking in tasks? (add previous versions to a list against the task on server and a version history tab)
priorities chart?
  - add chart to see number of usrs signed up, authored, with skills
